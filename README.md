# Part 2: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering Text or Images
I've created two artifacts:

- A complete Jupyter Notebook that implements the required clustering analysis, including:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Text vectorization using TF-IDF
  - Clustering with K-means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN algorithms.
  - Visualization using both PCA and t-SNE
  - Comprehensive EDA functions
- A markdown report summarizing the key findings and insights from the analysis.
